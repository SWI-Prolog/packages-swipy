\begin{abstract}
This package implements a bi-directional interface between Prolog and
Python using portable low-level primitives. The aim is to make Python
available to Prolog and visa versa with minimal installation effort
while providing a high level bi-directional interface with good
performance.

The API is being developed in close cooperation with the XSB and Ciao
teams as a pilot for the PIP (\jargon{Prolog Improvement Proposal})
initiative.  Janus should become the de-facto standard interface
between Python and Prolog.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:janus-intro}

Python has a huge developer community that maintains a large set of
resources, notably interfaces to just about anything one can imagine.
Making such interfaces directly available to Prolog can surely be
done.  However, developing an interface typically requires programming
in C or C++, a skill that is not widely available everywhere. Being
able to access Python effortlessly from Prolog puts us in a much
better position because Python experience is widely available in our
target audience. This solution was proposed in
\cite{DBLP:series/lncs-0001S23,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2308-15893},
initially developed for XSB.

Janus provides a bi-directional interface between Prolog and Python
using the low-level C API of both languages.  This makes using Python
from Prolog as simple as taking the standard SWI-Prolog distribution
and loading library \pllib{janus}. Using Prolog from Python is as simple as
\exam{import janus_swi as janus} and start making calls.  Both Prolog
and Python being dynamically typed languages, we can define an easy to
use interface that provides a \jargon{latency} of about one $\mu$S.

The Python interface is modeled after the recent JavaScript interface
developed for the WASM (Web Assembly) version.  That is

\begin{itemize}
\item A di-directional data conversion is defined.  See
  \secref{janus-data}.

\item A Prolog predicate py_call/2 to call Python functions and
  methods, as well as access and set object attributes.

\item A non-deterministic Prolog predicate py_iter/2 to
  enumerate a Python \jargon{iterator}.

\item A Python function \cfuncref{janus.query_once}{} to evaluate a
  Prolog query as once/1, providing input to Prolog variables using a
  Python dict and return a Python dict with bindings for each Prolog
  output variable.

\item A python function \cfuncref{janus.apply_once}{} to call a
  Prolog predicate with $N$ \jargon{input arguments} followed by
  exactly one \jargon{output argument}.  This provides a faster
  and easier to use interface to compliant predicates.

\item Python iterators \cfuncref{janus.query}{} and
  \cfuncref{janus.apply}{} that provide access to non-deterministic
  Prolog predicates using the calling conventions of
  \cfuncref{janus.query_once}{} and \cfuncref{janus.apply_once}{}.
\end{itemize}

The API of Janus is the result of discussions between the SWI-Prolog,
XSB and Ciao lang teams.  It will be reflected in a PIP
(\jargon{Prolog Improvement Proposal}).  Considering the large
differences in design an opinions in Prolog implementation, the PIP
does not cover all aspects of the API.  Many of the predicates and
functions have a \jargon{Compatibility} note that explains the
relation of the SWI-Prolog API and the PIP.  We summarize the
differences in \secref{janus-vs-xsb}.


\section{Data conversion}
\label{sec:janus-data}

The bi-directional conversion between Prolog and Python terms is
summarized in the table below.  For compatibility with Prolog
implementations without native dicts we support converting the
\verb${k1:v1, k2:v2, ...}$ to dicts.  Note that \verb${k1:v1, k2:v2}$ is
syntactic sugar for \verb${}(','(:(k1,v1), :(k2,v2)))$.  We allow for
embedding this in a \term{py}{Term} such that, with \const{py} defined
as \jargon{prefix operator}, \verb$py{k1:v1, k2:v2}$ is both valid
syntax as SWI-Prolog dict as as ISO Prolog compliant term and both are
translated into the same Python dict.  Note that \verb${}$ translates
to a Python string, while \verb$py({})$ translates into an empty
Python dict.

By default we translate Python strings into Prolog atoms.  Given we
support strings, this is somewhat dubious.  There are two reasons for
this choice.  One is the pragmatic reason that Python uses strings
both for \jargon{identifiers} and arbitrary text.  Ideally we'd have
the first translated to Prolog atoms and the latter to Prolog strings,
but, because we do not know which strings act as identifier and which
as just text, this is not possible.  The second is to improve
compatibility with Prolog systems that do not support strings.  Note
that py_call/3 and py_iter/3 provide the option
\term{py_string_as}{string} to obtain a string if this is desirable.

\end{center}

The interface supports unbounded integers and rational numbers.  Large
integers ($> 64$ bits) are converted using a hexadecimal string as
intermediate.  SWI-Prolog rational numbers are mapped to the Python
class \class{fractions:Fraction}.\footnote{Currently, mapping rational
numbers to fractions uses a string as intermediate representation and
may thus be slow.}

The conversion \#(Term) allows passing anything as a Python string. If
\arg{Term} is an atom or string, this is the same as passing the atom
or string.  Any other Prolog term is converted as defined by
write_canonical/1.  The conversion \term{prolog}{Term} creates an
instance of \cfuncref{janus.Term}{}. This class encapsulates a copy of
an arbitrary Prolog term. The SWI-Prolog implementation uses the
PL_record() and PL_recorded() functions to store and retrieve the
term.  \arg{Term} may be any Prolog term, including \jargon{blobs},
\jargon{attributed variables}.  Cycles and subterm sharing in
\arg{Term} are preserved. Internally, \cfuncref{janus.Term}{} is used
to represent Prolog exeptions that are raised during the execution of
\cfuncref{janus.query_once}{} or \cfuncref{janus.query}{}.

Python Tuples are array-like objects and thus map best to a Prolog
compound term.  There are two problems with this.  One is that few
systems support compound terms with arity zero, e.g., \term{f}{} and
many systems have a limit on the \jargon{arity} of compound terms.
Using Prolog \jargon{comma lists}, e.g., \verb$(a,b,c)$ does not
implement array semantics, cannot represent empty tuples and cannot
disambiguate tuples with one element from the element itself.  We
settled with compound terms using the \const{-} as functor to make
the common binary tuple map to a Prolog \jargon{pair}.


\section{Janus by example}
\label{sec:janus-examples}

This section introduces Janus calling Python from Prolog with examples.

\subsection{Janus calling spaCy}
\label{sec:janus-spacy}

The \href{https://spacy.io/}{spaCy} package provides natural language
processing.   This section illustrates the Janus library using spaCy.
Typically, spaCy and the English language models may be installed using

\begin{code}
> pip install spacy
> python -m spacy download en
\end{code}

After spaCy is installed, we can define \nopredref{model}{1} to
represent a Python object for the English language model using the
code below.  Note that by tabling this code as shared, the model is
loaded only once and is accessible from multiple Prolog threads.

\begin{code}
:- table english/1 as shared.

english(NLP) :-
    py_call(spacy:load(en_core_web_sm), NLP).
\end{code}

Calling \term{english}{X} results in \arg{X} =
\verb$<py_English>(0x7f703c24f430)$, a \jargon{blob} that references a
Python object.  \textit{English} is the name of the Python class to
which the object belongs and \textit{0x7f703c24f430} is the address of
the object.  The returned object implements the Python
\jargon{callable} protocol, i.e., it behaves as a function with
additional properties and methods.  Calling the model with a string
results in a parsed document.  We can use this from Prolog using the
built-in \const{__call__} method:

\begin{code}
?- english(NLP),
   py_call(NLP:'__call__'("This is a sentence."), Doc).
NLP = <py_English>(0x7f703851b8e0),
Doc = [<py_Token>(0x7f70375be9d0), <py_Token>(0x7f70375be930),
       <py_Token>(0x7f70387f8860), <py_Token>(0x7f70376dde40),
       <py_Token>(0x7f70376de200)
      ].
\end{code}

This is not what we want.  Because the spaCy \const{Doc} class
implements the \jargon{sequence} protocol it is translated into a
Prolog list of spaCy \const{Token} instances.  The \const{Doc} class
implements many more methods that we may wish to use.  An example is
\const{noun_chunks}, which provides a Python \jargon{generator} that
enumerates the noun chunks found in the input.  Each chunk is an
instance of \const{Span}, a sequence of \const{Token} instances that
have the property \const{text}.  The program below extracts the
noun chunks of the input as a non-deterministic Prolog predicate.
Note that we use \exam{py_object(true)} to get the parsed document
as a Python object.  Next, we use py_iter/2 to access the members
of the Python \jargon{iterator} returned by \exam{Doc.noun_chunks}
as Python object references and finally we extract the text of each
noun chunk as an atom.  The SWI-Prolog (atom) garbage collector will
take care of the \arg{Doc} and \arg{Span} Python objects.  Immediate
release of these objects can be enforced using py_free/1.\footnote{Janus
implementations are not required to implement Python object reference
garbage collection.}

\begin{code}
:- use_module(library(janus)).

:- table english/1.

english(NLP) :-
    py_call(spacy:load(en_core_web_sm),NLP).

noun(Sentence, Noun) :-
    english(NLP),
    py_call(NLP:'__call__'(Sentence), Doc, [py_object(true)]),
    py_iter(Doc:noun_chunks, Span, [py_object]),
    py_call(Span:text, Noun).
\end{code}

After which we can call

\begin{code}
?- noun("This is a sentence.", Noun).
Noun = 'This' ;
Noun = 'a sentence'.
\end{code}

The subsequent \secref{janus} documents the Prolog library
\pllib{janus}.

\input{libjanus.tex}

\subsection{Handling Python errors in Prolog}
\label{sec:janus-python-errors}

If py_call/2 or one of the other predicates that access Python causes
Python to raise an exception, this exception is translated into a
Prolog exception of the shape below. The library defines a rule for
print_message/2 to render these errors in a human readable way.

\begin{quote}
\term{error}{\term{python_error}{ErrorType, Value}, _}
\end{quote}

Here, \arg{ErrorType} is the name of the error type, as an atom, e.g.,
\const{'TypeError'}. \arg{Value} is the exception object represented by
a Python object reference. The \pllib{janus} defines the message
formatting, which makes us end up with a message like below.

\begin{code}
?- py_call(nomodule:noattr).
ERROR: Python 'ModuleNotFoundError':
ERROR:   No module named 'nomodule'
ERROR: In:
ERROR:   [10] janus:py_call(nomodule:noattr)
\end{code}

The Python \jargon{stack trace} is handed embedded into the second
argument of the \term{error}{Formal, ImplementationDefined}.  If
an exception is printed, printing the Python backtrace, is controlled
by the Prolog flags \const{py_backtrace} (default \const{true}) and
\const{py_backtrace_depth} (default \const{4}).

\begin{tags}
\tag{Compatibility} PIP.  The embedding of the Python backtrace is
SWI-Prolog specific.
\end{tags}

\subsection{Calling and data translation errors}
\label{sec:janus-data-errors}

Errors may occur when converting Prolog terms to Python objects
as defined in \secref{janus-data}.  These errors are reported as
\const{instantiation_error}, \term{type_error}{Type, Culprit} or
\term{domain_error}{Domain, Culprit}.

Defined \textbf{domains} are:

\begin{description}
  \termitem{py_constant}{}
  In a term \term{@}{Constant}, \arg{Constant} is not \const{true},
  \const{false} or \const{none}.   For example, \exam{py_call(print(@error))}.
  \termitem{py_keyword_arg}{}
  In a call to Python, a non keyword argument follows a keyword
  argument.   For example, \exam{py_call(m:f(1,x=2,3), R)}
  \termitem{py_string_as}{}
  The value for a \term{py_string_as}{As} option is invalid.  For
  example, \exam{py_call(m:f(), R, [py_string_as(codes)])}
  \termitem{py_dict_as}{}
  The value for a \term{py_dict_as}{As} option is invalid.  For
  example, \exam{py_call(m:f(), R, [py_dict_as(list)])}
  \termitem{py_term}{}
  A term being translated to Python is unsupported.  For example,
  \exam{py_call(m:f(point(1,2), R)}.
\end{description}

Defined \textbf{types} are:

\begin{description}
  \termitem{py_object}{}
  A Python object reference was expected.  For example,
  \exam{py_free(42)}
  \termitem{rational}{}
  A Python \const{fraction} instance is converted to a Prolog rational
  number, but the textual conversion does not produce a valid rational
  number.  This can happen if the Python \const{fraction} is subclassed
  and the \const{__str__()} method does not produce a correct string.
  \termitem{py_key_value}{}
  Inside a \exam{\{k:v, \ldots\}} representation for a dictionary we
  find a term that is not a key-value pair.  For example,
  \exam{py_call(m:f(\{a:1, x\}), R)}
  \termitem{py_set}{}
  Inside a \term{py_set}{Elements}, \arg{Elements} is not a list.
  For example, \exam{py_call(m:f(py_set(42), R)}.
  \termitem{py_target}{}
  In \term{py_call}{Target:FuncOrAttrOrMethod}, \arg{Target} is not
  a module (atom) or Python object reference.
  For example, \exam{py_call(7:f(), R)}.
  \termitem{py_callable}{}
  In \term{py_call}{Target:FuncOrAttrOrMethod}, \arg{FuncOrAttrOrMethod}
  is not an atom or compound.
  For example, \exam{py_call(m:7, R)}.
\end{description}




\subsection{Janus and virtual environments (venv)}
\label{sec:janus-venv}

An embedded Python system does not automatically pick up Python
virtual environments.  It is supposed to setup its own environment.
Janus is sensitive to Python \program{venv} environments.  Running
under such as environment is assumed if the environment variable
\const{VIRTUAL_ENV} points at a directory that holds a file
\file{pyvenv.cfg}.  If the virtual environment is detected, the
actions in the list below are taken.\footnote{This is based on
observing how Python 3.10 on Linux responds to being used inside a
virtual environment.  We do not know whether this covers all platforms
and versions.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Initialize Python using the \const{-I} flag to indicate
  \jargon{isolation}.
\item Set \const{sys.prefix} to the value of the \const{VIRTUAL_ENV}
  environment variable.
\item Remove all directories with base name \file{site-packages} or
  \file{dist-packages} from \const{sys.path}.\footnote{Note that
  \const{-I} only removes the personal packages directory, while
  the Python executable removes all, so we do the same.}
\item Add \file{$VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages} to
  \const{sys.path}, where \arg{X} and \arg{Y} are the major and minor
  version numbers of the embedded Python library.  If this directory
  does not exist we print a diagnostic warning.
\item Add a message to py_version/0 that indicates we are using
  a virtual environment and from which directory.
\end{itemize}


\section{Calling Prolog from Python}
\label{sec:janus-call-prolog}

The Janus interface can also call Prolog from Python.  Calling Prolog
from Python is the basis when embedding Prolog into Python using the
Python package \const{janus_swi}.  However, calling Prolog from Python
is also used to handle \jargon{call backs}.  Mutually recursive calls
between Python and Prolog are supported.  They should be handled with
some care as it is easy to crash the process due to a stack overflow.

Loading janus into Python is realized using the Python package
\const{janus-swi}, which defines the module \const{janus_swi}.  We do
not call this simply \const{janus} to allow coexistence of Janus for
multiple Prolog implementations.  Unless you plan to interact with
multiple Prolog systems in the same session, we advice to import janus
for SWI-Prolog as below.

\begin{code}
import janus_swi as janus
\end{code}

If Python is embedded into SWI-Prolog, the Python module may be
imported both as \const{janus} and \const{janus_swi}.  Using
\const{janus} allows the same Python code to be used from different
Prolog systems, while using \const{janus_swi} allows the same code to
be used both for embedding Python into Prolog and Prolog into Python.
In the remainder of this section we assume the Janus functions are
available in the name space \const{janus}.

The Python module \const{janus} provides utility functions and defines
the classes \cfuncref{janus.query}{}, \cfuncref{janus.apply}{},
\cfuncref{janus.Term}{}, \cfuncref{janus.Undefined}{} and
\cfuncref{janus.PrologError}{}.

The Python calling Prolog interface consist of four primitives,
distinguishing deterministic vs. non-deterministic Prolog queries and
two different calling conventions which we name \jargon{functional
  notation} and \jargon{relational notation}.  The \jargon{relational}
calling convention specifies a Prolog query as a string with an
\jargon{input dict} that provides (input) bindings for part of the
variables in the query string.  The results are represented as a dict
that holds the bindings of the output variables and the truth value
(see \secref{janus-truth}).  For example:

\begin{code}
>>> janus.query_once("Y is sqrt(X)", {'X':2})
{'truth': True, 'Y': 1.4142135623730951}
\end{code}

The functional notation calling convention specifies the query as a
module, predicate name and input arguments.  It calls the predicate
with one argument more than the number of input arguments and
translates the binding of the output argument to Python.  For example

\begin{code}
>>> janus.apply_once("user", "plus", 1, 2)
3
\end{code}

The table below summarizes the four primitives.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|r|cc|}
    \hline
               & \bf Relational notation  & \bf Functional notation \\
    \hline
    \bf det    & \cfuncref{janus.query_once}{}  & \cfuncref{janus.apply_once}{} \\
    \bf nondet & \cfuncref{janus.query}{} & \cfuncref{janus.apply}{} \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

We start our discussion by introducing the
\cfuncref{janus.query_once}{query,inputs} function for calling Prolog goals
as once/1. A Prolog goal is constructed from a string and a dict with
\jargon{input bindings} and returns \jargon{output bindings} as a
dict.  For example

\begin{code}
>>> import janus_swi as janus
>>> janus.query_once("Y is X+1", {"X":1})
{'Y': 2, 'truth': True}
\end{code}

Note that the input argument may also be passed literally. Below we
give two examples. We \textbf{strongly advise against using string
  interpolation} for three reasons.  Firstly, the query strings are
compiled and cached on the Prolog sided and (thus) we assume a finite
number of distinct query strings.  Secondly, string interpolation is
sensitive to \jargon{injection attacks}.  Notably inserting quoted
strings can easily be misused to create malicious queries.  Thirdly
and finally, serializing and deserializing the data is generally
slower then using the input dictionary, especially if the data is
large. Using a dict for input and output together with a (short)
string to denote the goal is easy to use and fast.

\begin{code}
>>> janus.query_once("Y is 1+1", {})    # Ok for "static" queries
{'Y': 2, 'truth': True}
>>> x = 1
>>> janus.query_once(f"Y is {x}+1", {}) # WRONG, See above
{'Y': 2, 'truth': True}
\end{code}

The \jargon{output dict} contains all named Prolog variables that (1)
are not in the input dict and (2) do not start with an underscore. For
example, to get the grandparents of a person given parent/2 relations we
can use the code below, where the \arg{_GP} and \arg{_P} do not appear
in the output dict. This both saves time and avoids the need to convert
Prolog data structures that cannot be represented in Python such as
variables or arbitrary compound terms.

\begin{code}
>>> janus.query_once("findall(_GP, parent(Me, _P), parent(_P, _GP), GPs)",
               {'Me':'Jan'})["GPs"]
[ 'Kees', 'Jan' ]
\end{code}

In addition to the variable bindings the dict contains a key
\const{truth}\footnote{Note that variable bindings always start with
an uppercase latter.}  that represents the truth value of evaluating
the query.  In normal Prolog this is a Python Boolean.  In systems
that implement \jargon{Well Founded Semantics}, this may also be an
instance of the class \cfuncref{janus.Undefined}{}.  See
\secref{janus-truth} for details. If evaluation of the query failed,
all variable bindings are bound to the Python constant \const{None}
and the \const{truth} key has the value \const{False}.  The following
Python function returns \const{True} if the Prolog system supports
unbounded integers and \const{False} otherwise.

\begin{code}
def hasBigIntegers():
    janus.query_once("current_prolog_flag(bounded,false)")['truth']
\end{code}

While \cfuncref{janus.query_once}{} deals with semi-deterministic
goals, the class \cfuncref{janus.query}{} implements a Python
\jargon{iterator} that iterates over the solutions of a Prolog
goal. The iterator may be aborted using the Python \exam{break}
statement.  As with \cfuncref{janus.query_once}{}, the returned dict
contains a \const{truth} field.  This field cannot be \const{False}
though and thus is either \const{True} or an instance of the class
\cfuncref{janus.Undefined}{}

\begin{code}
import janus_swi as janus

def printRange(from, to):
    for d in janus.query("between(F,T,X)", {"F":from, "T":to})
        print(d["X"])
\end{code}

Iterators may be nested.  For example,  we can create a list of tuples
like below.

\begin{code}
def double_iter(w,h):
    tuples=[]
    for yd in janus.query("between(1,M,Y)", {"M":h}):
        for xd in janus.query("between(1,M,X)", {"M":w}):
            tuples.append((xd['X'],yd['Y']))
    return tuples
\end{code}

After this, we may run

\begin{code}
>>> demo.double_iter(2,3)
[(1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]
\end{code}

In addition to the \jargon{iterator} protocol that class
\cfuncref{janus.query}{} implements, it also implements the methods
\cfuncref{janus.query.next}{} and \cfuncref{janus.query.close}{}.
This allows for e.g.

\begin{code}
    q = query("between(1,3,X)")
    while ( s := q.next() ):
        print(s['X'])
    q.close()
\end{code}


But, \textbf{iterators based on Prolog goals are fragile}.  This
is because, while it is possible to open and run a new query while
there is an open query, the inner query must be closed before we
can ask for the next solution of the outer query.  We illustrate
this using the sequence below.

\begin{code}
>>> q1 = query("between(1,3,X)")
>>> q2 = query("between(1,3,X)")
>>> q2.next()
{'truth': True, 'X': 1}
>>> q1.next()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
swipl.Error: swipl.next_solution(): not inner query
>>> q2.close()
>>> q1.next()
{'truth': True, 'X': 1}
>>> q1.close()
\end{code}

\textbf{Failure to close a query typically leaves SWI-Prolog in an
inconsistent state and further interaction with Prolog is likely to
crash the process}.  Future versions may improve on that.


\begin{description}
  \cfunction{dict}{janus.query_once}{query, inputs=\{{}\}, keep=False,
			            truth_vals=TruthVals.PLAIN_TRUTHVALS}
Call \arg{query} using \arg{bindings} as once/1, returning a dict with
the resulting bindings. If \arg{bindings} is omitted, no variables are
bound. The \arg{keep} parameter determines whether or not Prolog
discards all backtrackable changes.  By default, such changes are
discarded and as a result, changes to backtrackable global variables
are lost.  Using \const{True}, such changes are preserved.

\begin{code}
>>> query_once("b_setval(a, 1)", keep=True)
{'truth': 'True'}
>>> query_once("b_getval(a, X)")
{'truth': 'True', 'X': 1}
\end{code}

If \arg{query} fails, the variables of the query are bound to the Python
constant \const{None}. The \arg{bindings} object includes a key
\const{truth}\footnote{As this name is not a valid Prolog variable
name, this cannot be ambiguous.} that has the value \const{False} (query
failed, all bindings are \const{None}), \const{True} (query succeeded,
variables are bound to the result converting Prolog data to Python) or
an instance of the class \cfuncref{janus.Undefined}{}.  The information
carried by this instance is determined by the \const{truth} parameter.
Below is an example.  See \secref{janus-truth} for details.

\begin{code}
>>> import janus_swi as janus
>>> janus.query_once("undefined")
{'truth': Undefined}
\end{code}

See also \cfuncref{janus.cmd}{} and \cfuncref{janus.apply_once}{},
which provide a fast but more limited alternative for making ground
queries (\cfuncref{janus.cmd}{}) or queries with leading ground
arguments followed by a single output variable.

    \cfunction{dict}{janus.once}{query, inputs=\{{}\}, keep=False,
			         truth_vals=TruthVals.PLAIN_TRUTHVALS}
    \jargon{Deprecated}.  Renamed to \cfuncref{janus.query_once}{}.

    \cfunction{Any}{janus.apply_once}{module, predicate, *input, fail=obj}
    \jargon{Functional notation} style calling of a deterministic Prolog
    predicate.  This calls \term{module:predicate}{Input \ldots, Output}, where
    \arg{Input} are the Python \arg{input} arguments converted to
    Prolog.  On success, \arg{Output} is converted to Python and
    returned.  On failure a \cfuncref{janus.PrologError}{} exception
    is raised unless the \const{fail} parameter is specified.  In the
    latter case the function returns \arg{obj}.  This interface
    provides a comfortable and fast calling convention for calling a
    simple predicate with suitable calling conventions.  The
    example below returns the \jargon{home directory} of the SWI-Prolog
    installation.

\begin{code}
>>> import janus_swi as janus
>>> janus.apply_once("user", "current_prolog_flag", "home")
'/home/janw/src/swipl-devel/build.pdf/home'
\end{code}

\begin{tags}
\tag{Compatibility} PIP.
\end{tags}

    \cfunction{Truth}{janus.cmd}{module, predicate, *input}
    Similar to \cfuncref{janus.apply_once}{}, but no argument for the
    return value is added.  This function returns the \jargon{truth
      value} using the same conventions as the \const{truth} key
    in \cfuncref{janus.query_once}{}.  For example:

\begin{code}
>>> import janus_swi as janus
>>> cmd("user", "true")
True
>>> cmd("user", "current_prolog_flag", "bounded", "true")
False
>>> cmd("user", "undefined")
Undefined
>>> cmd("user", "no_such_predicate")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3.10/code.py", line 90, in runcode
    exec(code, self.locals)
  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
janus.PrologError: '$c_call_prolog'/0: Unknown procedure: no_such_predicate/0
\end{code}

    The function \cfuncref{janus.query_once}{} is more flexible and
    provides all functionality of \cfuncref{janus.cmd}{}.  However,
    this function is faster and in some scenarios easier to use.

\begin{tags}
\tag{Compatibility} PIP.
\end{tags}

    \cfunction{None}{janus.consult}{file, data=None, module='user'}
    Load Prolog text into the Prolog database.   By default, \arg{data}
    is \const{None} and the text is read from \arg{file}.  If \arg{data}
    is a string, it provides the Prolog text that is loaded and \arg{file}
    is used as \jargon{identifier} for source locations and error messages.
    The \arg{module} argument denotes the target module.  That is where the
    clauses are added to if the Prolog text does not define a module or
    where the exported predicates of the module are imported into.

    If \arg{data} is not provided and \arg{file} is not accessible
    this raises a Prolog exception.  Errors that occur during the
    compilation are printed using print_message/2 and can currently
    not be captured easily.  The script below prints the train
    connections as a list of Python tuples.

    \begin{code}
    import janus_swi as janus

    janus.consult("trains", """
    train('Amsterdam', 'Haarlem').
    train('Amsterdam', 'Schiphol').
    """)

    print([d['Tuple'] for d in
           janus.query("train(_From,_To),Tuple=_From-_To")])

  \tag{Compatibility} PIP.   The \const{data} and \const{module} keyword

\subsection{Janus iterator query}
\label{sec:janus-class-query}

Class \cfuncref{janus.query}{} is similar to the
\cfuncref{janus.query_once}{} function, but it returns a Python
\jargon{iterator} that allows for iterating over the answers to a
non-deterministic Prolog predicate.

\begin{description}
   \cfunction{query}{janus.query}{query, inputs=\{{}\}, keep=False}
   As \cfuncref{janus.query_once}{}, returning an \jargon{iterator} that
   provides an answer dict as \cfuncref{janus.query_once}{} for each answer
   to \arg{query}.  Answers never have \const{truth} \const{False}.
   See discussion above.

\begin{tags}
\tag{Compatibility} PIP.  The \const{keep} is a SWI-Prolog extension.
\end{tags}

   \cfunction{Query}{janus.Query}{query, inputs=\{{}\}, keep=False}
   \jargon{Deprecated}.  This class was renamed to \cfuncref{janus.query}.

   \cfunction{dict{|}None}{janus.query.next}{}
   Explicitly ask for the next solution of the iterator.  Normally,
   using the \ctype{query} as an iterator is to be preferred.  See
   discussion above.

   \cfunction{None}{janus.query.close}{}
   Close the query.  Closing a query is obligatory.  When used as
   an iterator, the Python destructor (\cfuncref{__del__}{}) takes
   care of closing the query.

\begin{tags}
\tag{Compatibility} PIP.
\end{tags}
\end{description}

\subsection{Janus iterator apply}
\label{sec:janus-class-apply}

Class \cfuncref{janus.apply}{} is similar to \cfuncref{janus.apply_once}{},
calling a Prolog predicate using functional notation style.  It returns
a Python \jargon{iterator} that enumerates all answers.

\begin{description}
  \cfunction{apply}{janus.apply}{module, predicate, *input}
  As \cfuncref{janus.apply_once}{}, returning an \jargon{iterator}
  that returns individual answers.  The example below uses Python
  \jargon{list comprehension} to create a list of integers from
  the Prolog built-in between/3.

\begin{code}
>>> [*janus.apply("user", "between", 1, 6)]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
\end{code}

\begin{tags}
\tag{Compatibility} PIP.
\end{tags}

   \cfunction{any{|}None}{janus.apply.next}{}
   Explicitly ask for the next solution of the iterator.  Normally,
   using the \ctype{apply} as an iterator is to be preferred.  See
   discussion above.   Note that this calling convention cannot
   distinguish between the Prolog predicate returning \const{@none}
   and reaching the end of the iteration.

   \cfunction{None}{janus.apply.close}{}
   Close the query.  Closing a query is obligatory.  When used as
   an iterator, the Python destructor (\cfuncref{__del__}{}) takes
   care of closing the query.

\begin{tags}
\tag{Compatibility} PIP.
\end{tags}
\end{description}

\subsection{Janus access to Python locals and globals}
\label{sec:janus-locals-and-globals}

Python provides access to dictionaries holding the local variables of
a function using \cfuncref{locals}{} as well as the global variables
stored as attributes to the module to which the function belongs as
\cfuncref{globals}{}.  The Python C API provides
\cfuncref{PyEval_GetLocals}{} and \cfuncref{PyEval_GetGlobals}{}, but
these return the scope of the Janus API function rather than user
code, i.e., the global variables of the \const{janus} module and the
local variables of the running Janus interface function.

Python code that wishes Prolog to access its scope must pass the
necessary scope elements (local and global variables) explicitly to
the Prolog code.  It is possible to pass the entire local and or
global scope by the output of \cfuncref{locals}{} and/or
\cfuncref{globals}{}.  Note however that a dict passed to Prolog is
translated to its Prolog representation.  This representation may be
prohibitively large and does not allow Prolog to modify variables in
the scope.  Note that Prolog can access the global scope of a module
as attributes of this module, e.g.

\begin{code}
increment :-
    py_call(demo:counter, V0),
    V is V0+1,
    py_setattr(demo, counter, V).
\end{code}

\subsection{Janus and Prolog truth}
\label{sec:janus-truth}

In traditional Prolog, queries \jargon{succeed} or \jargon{fail}.
Systems that implement tabling with \jargon{Well Founded Semantics}
such as XSB and SWI-Prolog define a third truth value typically called
\jargon{undefined}.  Undefined results may have two reasons; (1) the
program is logically inconsistent or (2) \jargon{restraints} have been
applied in the derivation.

Because classical Prolog truth is dominant, we represent the success
of a query using the Python booleans \const{True} and \const{False}.
For undefined answers we define a class \cfuncref{janus.Undefined}{}
that may represent different levels of detail on why the result is
undefined.  The notion of \jargon{generic undefined} is represented by
a unique instance of this class.  The three truth values are
accessible as properties of the \const{janus} module.

\begin{description}
  \definition{janus.true}
This property has the Python boolean \const{True}
  \definition{janus.false}
This property has the Python boolean \const{False}
  \definition{janus.undefined}
This property holds a unique instance of class
\cfuncref{janus.Undefined}{}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Janus classed Undefined and TruthVal}
\label{sec:janus-class-undefined}

The class \cfuncref{janus.Undefined}{} represents an undefined result
under the \jargon{Well Founded Semantics}.

\begin{description}
  \cfunction{Undefined}{janus.Undefined}{term=None}
  Instances are never created explicitly by the user.  They are
  created by the calls to Prolog initiated from \cfuncref{janus.query_once}{}
  and \cfuncref{janus.query}{}.

  The class has a single property class \const{term} that represents
  either the \jargon{delay list} or the \jargon{residual program}.  See
  \cfuncref{janus.TruthVal}{} for details.

  \cfunction{Enum}{janus.TruthVal}{}
  This class is a Python \jargon{enumeration}.  Its values are passed
  as the optional \arg{truth} parameter to \cfuncref{janus.query_once}{} and
  \cfuncref{janus.query}{}.   The defined instances are

  \begin{description}
    \definition{NO_TRUTHVALS}
    Undefined results are reported as \const{True}.  This is quite
    pointless in the current design and this may go.
    \definition{PLAIN_TRUTHVALS}
    Return undefined results as \const{janus.undefined}, a
    unique instance of the class \cfuncref{janus.Undefined}{}.
    \definition{DELAY_LISTS}
    Return undefined results as an instance of class
    \cfuncref{janus.Undefined}{}. thats holds the delay list
    in Prolog native representation.  See call_delays/2.
    \definition{RESIDUAL_PROGRAM}
    Return undefined results as an instance of class
    \cfuncref{janus.Undefined}{}. thats holds the \jargon{residual
    program} in Prolog native representation.  See
    call_residual_program/2.
  \end{description}

  The instances of this enumeration are available as attributed of
  the \const{janus} module.
\end{description}

For example, given Russel's paradox defined in Prolog as below.

\begin{code}
:- module(russel, [shaves/2]).

:- table shaves/2.

shaves(barber,P) :- person(P),  tnot(shaves(P,P)).
person(barber).
person(mayor).
\end{code}

From Python, we may ask who shaves the barber in four ways as
illustrated below.  Note that the Prolog representations for
\const{janus.DELAY_LISTS} and \const{janus.RESIDUAL_PROGRAM}
use the write_canonical/1 notation.  They may later be changed
to use a more human friendly notation.

\begin{code}
# Using NO_TRUTHVALS
>>> janus.query_once("russel:shaves(barber, X)", truth_vals=janus.NO_TRUTHVALS)
{'truth': True, 'X': 'barber'}

# Using default PLAIN_TRUTHVALS (default)
>>> janus.query_once("russel:shaves(barber, X)")
{'truth': Undefined, 'X': 'barber'}

# Using default DELAY_LISTS
>>> janus.query_once("russel:shaves(barber, X)", truth_vals=janus.DELAY_LISTS)
{'truth': :(russel,shaves(barber,barber)), 'X': 'barber'}

# Using default RESIDUAL_PROGRAM
>>> janus.query_once("russel:shaves(barber, X)", truth_vals=janus.RESIDUAL_PROGRAM)
{'truth': [:-(:(russel,shaves(barber,barber)),tnot(:(russel,shaves(barber,barber))))], 'X': 'barber'}
\end{code}


\subsection{Janus class Term}
\label{sec:janus-class-term}

Class \cfuncref{janus.Term}{} encapsulates a Prolog term.  Similarly to the
Python object reference (see py_is_object/1), the class allows Python
to represent arbitrary Prolog data, typically with the intend to pass
it back to Prolog.

\begin{description}
  \cfunction{Term}{janus.Term}{*args}
  Instances are never created explicitly by the user.   An instance is
  created by handling a term \term{prolog}{Term} to the data conversion
  process.   As a result, we can do

\begin{code}
?- py_call(janus:echo(prolog(hello(world))), Obj,
           [py_object(true)]).
Obj = <py_Term>(0x7f7a14512050).
?- py_call(print($Obj)).
hello(world)
Obj = <py_Term>(0x7f7a14512050).
\end{code}

  \cfunction{Term}{janus.Term.__str__}{}
  Return the output of print/1 on the term.  This is what is used by
  the Python function print().

  \cfunction{Term}{janus.Term.__repr__}{}
  Return the output of write_canonical/1 on the term.
\end{description}

\subsection{Janus class PrologError}
\label{sec:janus-class-prolog-error}

Class \cfuncref{janus.PrologError}{}, derived from the Python class
\class{Exception} represents a Prolog exception that typically results
from calling \cfuncref{janus.query_once}{},
\cfuncref{janus.apply_once}{}, \cfuncref{janus.query}{} or
\cfuncref{janus.apply}{}.  The class either encapsulates a string on a
Prolog exception term using \class{janus.Term}.  Prolog exceptions are
used to represent errors raised by Prolog.  Strings are used to
represent errors from invalid use of the interface.  The default
behavior gives the expected message:

\begin{code}
>>> x = janus.query_once("X is 3.14/0")['X']
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
janus.PrologError: //2: Arithmetic: evaluation error: `zero_divisor'
\end{code}

At this moment we only define a single Python class for representing
Prolog exceptions.  This suffices for error reporting, but does not
make it easy to distinguish different Prolog errors.  Future versions
may improve on that by either subclassing \class{janus.PrologError}
or provide a method to classify the error more easily.

\begin{description}
  \cfunction{PrologError}{janus.PrologError}{TermOrString}
  The constructor may be used explicitly, but this should be very uncommon.
  \cfunction{String}{janus.PrologError.__str__}{}
  Return a human readable message for the error using message_to_string/2
  \cfunction{String}{janus.PrologError.__repr__}{}
  Return a formal representation of the error by means of write_canonical/1.
\end{description}

\section{Janus and threads}
\label{sec:janus-threads}

Where SWI-Prolog support native preemptively scheduled threads that
exploit multiple cores, Python has a single interpreter that can
switch between native threads.\footnote{Actually, you can create
multiple Python interpreters. It is not yet clear to us whether that
can help improving on concurrency.} Initially the Python interpreter
is associated with the thread that created it which, for janus, is the
first thread calling Python.  The Prolog thread that initiated Janus
may terminate.  This does not affect the embedded Python interpreter
and this interpreter may continue to be used from other Prolog threads.

Janus ensures it holds the Python GIL when interacting with the Python
interpreter.  If Python calls Prolog, the GIL is released using
\const{Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS}.

\begin{itemize}
\item Multiple Prolog threads can make calls to Python.  The
  access to Python is \jargon{serialized}.  If a Prolog thread
  does not want other threads to use Python it can use
  py_with_gil/1.  When multiple Prolog threads make many
  calls to Python performance tends to drop significantly.

\item Multiple Python threads can make calls to Prolog. While
  Prolog is working on the query, the Python interpreter may switch
  to other Python threads.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Calling Prolog from a Python thread}
\label{sec:janus-thread-call-prolog}

Prolog may be called safely from any Python thread.  The Prolog
execution is embraced with \const{Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS} and
\const{Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS}, which implies that Python is
allowed to switch to another thread while Prolog is doing its
work.

If the calling Python thread is not the one that initiated Janus,
\cfuncref{janus.query_once}{} and \cfuncref{janus.query}{} attach and detach
a temporary Prolog engine using PL_thread_attach_engine() and
PL_thread_destroy_engine().  This is relatively costly.  In addition
we allow associating a Prolog engine persistently with the calling
thread.

\begin{description}
  \cfunction{int}{janus.engine}{}
  Return the identifier of the Prolog engine associated to the current
  thread, -1 if no engine is attached or -2 if this version of Prolog
  does not support engines.

  \cfunction{int}{janus.attach_engine}{}
  Attach a Prolog engine to the current thread using
  PL_thread_attach_engine().  On success, return the integer thread id
  of the created Prolog engine.\footnote{The current implementation
  passes \const{NULL} to PL_thread_attach_engine().  Future versions
  may provide access to the creation attributes.}

  If the thread already has an engine the \textit{attach count} is
  incremented and the current engine id is returned.  The engine is
  detached after a matching number of calls to
  \cfuncref{janus.detach_engine}{}

  \cfunction{None}{janus.detach_engine}{}
  Decrement the \textit{attach count} of the attached Prolog engine.
  Destroy the engine if this count drops to zero.  Raises an exception
  of the calling thread is not attached to a Prolog engine.
\end{description}

\subsection{Python and Prolog deadlocks}
\label{sec:janus-deadlocks}

In a threaded environment, Python calls must be guarded by
PyGILState_Ensure() and PyGILState_Release() that ultimately
lock/unlock a \jargon{mutex}.  Unfortunately there is no
PyGILState_TryEnsure() and therefore we may create deadlocks when
Prolog locks are involved.  This may either apply to explicit Prolog
locks from with_mutex/2 and friends or implicit locks on e.g. I/O
streams.  The classical scenario is thread $A$ holding the Python GIL
and wanting to call Prolog code that locks a mutex $M$, while thread
$B$ holds $M$ and wishes to make a Python call and this tries to lock
the GIL.  The predicate py_gil_owner/1 can be used to help diagnosing
such issues.

\subsection{Janus versions}
\label{sec:janus-version}

The current version as an integer can be accessed as
\exam{janus.version}.  The integer uses the same conventions as the
SWI-Prolog flag \const{version} and is defined as $10,000*Major +
100*Minor + Patch$.  In addition, the module defines the following
functions:

\begin{description}
  \cfunction{str}{janus.version_str}{}
  Return the Janus version as a string \arg{Major.Minor.Patch}.
  \cfunction{None}{janus.version}{}
  Print information about Janus and SWI-Prolog version.
\end{description}

\section{Janus as a Python package}
\label{sec:janus-python-package}

The \href{https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/packages-swipy}{Janus GIT
repo} provides \file{setup.py}.  Janus may be installed as a Python
package after downloading using

\begin{code}
pip install .
\end{code}

\program{pip} allows for installation from the git repository in a
one-liner as below.

\begin{code}
pip install git+https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/packages-swipy.git#egg=janus_swi
\end{code}

Installing janus as a Python package requires

\begin{itemize}
\item The \program{swipl} program in the default search path.  The
  \file{setup.py} runs \exam{swipl --dump-runtime-variables} to obtain
  the installation locations of the various Prolog components.  On Windows,
  if  \program{swipl} is not on \verb$%PATH%$, \file{setup.py} tries
  the registry to find the default binary installation.
\item A C compiler that can be used by \program{pip}.  The janus interface
  has been tested to compile using GCC, Clang and Microsoft Visual C++.
\end{itemize}

After successful installation we should be able to use Prolog directly
from Python.  For example:

\begin{code}
python
>>> from janus_swi import *
>>> query_once("writeln('Hello world!')")
Hello world!
{'truth': True}
>>> [a["D"] for a in query("between(1,6,D)")]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
>>> prolog()
?- version.
Welcome to SWI-Prolog (threaded, 64 bits, version 9.1.12-8-g70b70a968-DIRTY)
SWI-Prolog comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. This is free software.
...
?-
\end{code}

\section{Prolog and Python}
\label{sec:janus-prolog-python}

Prolog is a very different language than imperative languages.  An
interesting similarity is the notion of \jargon{backtracking} vs.
Python \jargon{iterators}.

To be extended.

\section{Janus performance evaluation}
\label{sec:janus-performance}

Below is a table to give some feeling on the overhead of making calls
between Prolog and Python. These figures are roughly the same as the
figures for the XSB/Python interface. All benchmarks have been executed
on AMD3950X running Ubuntu 22.04, SWI-Prolog 9.1.11 and Python 3.10.6.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{3in}|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Action} & \textbf{Time (seconds)} \\
\hline
Echo list with 1,000,000 elements & 0.12 \\
Call Pyton \exam{demo:int()} from Prolog 1,000,000 times & 0.44 \\
Call Pyton \exam{demo:sumlist3(5,[1,2,3])} from Prolog 1,000,000 times & 1.4 \\
Call Prolog \exam{Y is X+1} from Python 1,000,000 times & 1.9 \\
Iterate from Python over Prolog goal \exam{between(1, 1 000 000, X)} & 1.1 \\
Iterate over Python iterator \exam{range(1,1000000)} from Prolog & 0.17 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Python or C/C++ for accessing resources?}
\label{sec:janus-vs-c}

Using Python as an intermediate to access external resources allows
writing such interfaces with less effort by a much wider community. The
resulting interface is often also more robust due to well defined data
conversion and sound memory management that you get for free.

Nevertheless, Python often accesses resources with a C or C++ API. We
can also create this bridge directly, bypassing Python. That avoids one
layer of data conversion and preserves the excellent multi-threading
capabilities of SWI-Prolog. As is, Python operations are synchronized
using the Python \jargon{GIL}, a global lock that allows for only a
single thread to use Python at the same time.\footnote{There are rumors
that Python's multi threading will be able to use multiple cores.}

Writing an interface for SWI-Prolog is typically easier that for
Python/C because memory management is easier. Where we need to manage
reference counts to Python objects through all possibly paths of the C
functions, SWI-Prolog \ctype{term_t} merely has to be allocated once in
the function. All failure parts will discard the Prolog data
automatically through backtracking and all success paths will do so
through the Prolog garbage collector.\footnote{Using a Python C++
interface such as \href{https://github.com/pybind/pybind11}{pybind11}
simplifies memory management for a Python interface.}

Summarizing, Janus is ideal to get started quickly.  Applications that
need to access C/C++ resources and need either exploit all cores of
your hardware or get the best performance on calls or exchanging data
should consider using the C or C++ interfaces of SWI-Prolog.

\section{Janus platforms notes}
\label{sec:janus-platforms}

Janus relies on the C APIs of Prolog and Python and functions
therefore independent from the platform.  While the C, Python and
Prolog code the builds Janus is platform independent, dynamically
loading Prolog into Python or Python into Prolog depends on versions
as well as several properties of the dynamic linking performed by
the platform.  In the sections below we describe some of the issues.

\subsection{Janus on Windows}
\label{sec:janus-on-windows}

We tested the Windows platform using SWI-Prolog binaries from
\href{https://www.swi-prolog.org/Downloads.html}{https://www.swi-prolog.org/Downloads.html}
and Python downloaded from
\href{https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/}{https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/}.
The SWI-Prolog binary provides \file{janus.dll} which is linked to
\file{python3.dll}, a ``stable API'' based wrapper that each Python~3
binary distribution provides in addition to \file{python3xx.dll}.  Calling
Python from Prolog is supported out of the box, provided the folder holding
\file{python3.dll} is in the search \verb$%PATH%$.

The Python package can be installed using \program{pip} as described in
\secref{janus-python-package}.  Once built, this package finds SWI-Prolog
on \verb$%PATH%$ or using the registry and should be fairly independent
from the Prolog version as long as it is version 9.1.12 or later.

\subsection{Janus on Linux}
\label{sec:janus-on-linux}

On Linux systems we bind to the currently installed Prolog and Python
version.  This should work smoothly from source.  Janus is included in
the \href{https://www.swi-prolog.org/build/PPA.html}{PPA distribution}
for Ubuntu as well as in the
\href{https://www.swi-prolog.org/Docker.html}{Docker images}.   It is
currently not part of the SNAP distribution.

See \secref{janus-python-package} for for building the \const{janus_swi}
Python package.

\subsection{Janus on MacOS}
\label{sec:janus-on-macos}

Unfortunately MacOS versions of Python do not ship with the equivalent
of \file{python3.dll} found on Windows.  This implies we can only compile
our binaries against a specific version of Python.  We will use the
default Python binary for that, which is installed in
\file{/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/}

The Macports version is also linked against an explicit version of
Python, in this case provided by Macports.

The Python package \const{janus_swi} may be compiled against any version
of Python selected by \program{pip}.  See \secref{janus-python-package}
for details.


\section{Compatibility to the XSB Janus implementation}
\label{sec:janus-vs-xsb}

We aim to provide an interface that is close enough to allow
developing Prolog code that uses Python and visa versa.  Differences
between the two Prolog implementation make this non-trivial.
SWI-Prolog has native support for \jargon{dicts}, \jargon{strings},
\jargon{unbounded integers}, \jargon{rational numbers} and
\jargon{blobs} that provide safe pointers to external objects that are
subject to (atom) garbage collection.

We try to find a compromise to make the data conversion as close as
possible while supporting both systems as good as possible.  For this
reason we support creating a Python dict both from a SWI-Prolog dict
and from the Prolog term \verb$py({k1:v1, k2:v2, ...})$.  With
\const{py} defined as a prefix operator, this may be written without
parenthesis and is thus equivalent to the SWI-Prolog dict syntax.
The \pllib{janus} library provides access predicates that are
supported by both systems and where the SWI-Prolog version supports
both SWI-Prolog dicts and the above Prolog representation.  See
items/2, values/3, key/2 and items/2.

Calling Python from Prolog provides a low-level and a more high level
interface.  The high level interface is realized by py_call/[2,3] and
py_iter/[2,3]. We realize the low level interfaces py_func/[3,4] and
py_dot/[4,5] on top of py_call/2.  The interface for calling Prolog
from Python is settled on the five primitives described in
\secref{janus-call-prolog}.

We are discussing to minimize the differences.  Below we summarize the
known differences.

\begin{itemize}
\item SWI-Prolog represents Phyton dicts as Prolog dicts.  XSB uses
  a term py(\{k:v, ...\}), where the \verb$py()$ wrapper is optional.
  The predicate py_is_dict/1 may be used to test that a Prolog term
  represents a Python dict.  The predicates values/3, keys/2, key/2
  and items/2 can be used to access either representation.
\item SWI-Prolog allows for \term{prolog}{Term} to be sent to
  Python, creating an instance of \cfuncref{janus.Term}{}.
\item SWI-Prolog represents Python object references as a \jargon{blob}.
  XSB uses a term.  The predicate py_is_object/1 may be used to test
  that a Prolog term refers to a Python object.   In XSB, the user
  \emph{must} call py_free/1 when done with some object.  In SWI-Prolog,
  either py_free/1 may be used or the object may be left to the Prolog
  (atom) garbage collector.
\item Prolog exceptions passed to Python are represented differently.
\item When calling Prolog from Python and relying on well founded
  semantics, only \jargon{plain truth values} (i.e., \const{janus.undefined}
  are supported in a portable way.  \jargon{Delay lists}, providing
  details on why the result is undefined, are represented differently.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Writing portable Janus modules}
\label{sec:janus-portable-code}

This section will be written after the dust has settled.   Topics

\begin{itemize}
\item Dealing with Python dicts
\item Dealing with Prolog modules
\item Dealing with Prolog references to Python objects
\item More?
\end{itemize}


\section{Status of Janus}
\label{sec:janus-status}

The current version of this Janus library must be considered \jargon{beta}
code.

\begin{itemize}
\item The design is stable
\item Naming and functionality are almost stable.
\item Testing is not exhaustive.
\end{itemize}
